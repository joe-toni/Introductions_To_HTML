        <section id="intro" class="subject">As you might have read from the introduction HTML is an element driven language
            and while this gives us a number of elements we can chose from to work with, where we place them how we organize them 
            is realy important both for porper semantics and for referencing when looking for the items in a javascript file. Hence Sectioning
            tags or tags that are specifically made to make the separation of portions with some more generic than others. With some of the more specifically
            named ones usually reserved for commonly designated portions such as header, footer, or aside. In this area we will be going over some of these tags.

<!--Spacing for "address" section-->
        <section id="address" class="subject" data-content="
        <address>

        <address>">
            <h3>&ltaddress&gt: The "Address" element</h3>
            <p>
               The &ltaddress&gt elment is used for indicating that the content contained within is some sort of contact information.
               The contact information provided can be actuall addresses email or otherwise, phone numbers, social media handles, and so on.
               This elment can be included multiple times in a document if appropriate. Take for example an online magazine with more than one 
               article in a page each with different authors, you could include and address element for each of the articles as needed. 
               The text included within the elment will be italicized by default.

        <section id="article" class="subject" data-content="

     </article>">
            <h3>&ltarticle&gt: The "Article" element</h3>
            <p>
                The &ltarticle&gt elemet is used for sections that are meant to be resused in other works or can be used independently from the rest of the document.
                Consider items such as seperate articles in a magazine, an individual post, or some interactive widget such as the one used in this site. 
                It has no special renduring and can be styled by name in CSS.
            </p>

<!--Spacing for  "aside" section-->
    <section id="aside" class="subject" data-content="

    <aside>
    </div>">
        <h3>&ltaside&gt: The "Aside" element</h3>
        <p>
            The &ltaside&gt element is used for sections of a document that are in someway related to the main portion, 
            but can be seperated for a better flow of content. Consider tips, notes, sidebars and other such examples. Slightly different
            from an <a href="#article">article</a> element in that it is typically ment to remain connected to the main content. 
            The element provides no special renduring but can by styled by name using CSS.

        <h1>How to use a Footer</h1>
        <p>
            This is an example of how to include a footer. Consider this to be the main 
            portion of the sample article.
        </p>
         <footer>
            author: JAFT
        <footer>
    </article>">
        <h3>&ltfooter&gt: The "Footer" element</h3>
        <p>
            The footer is similar to the footer of any normal document and is expected to contain information such as 
            authorship information, copyright information, contact information, sitemap, and other related documents. A footer element can be included several times in a 
            document since it can be used for different portions some of which call for their own footers.

    </figure>">
        <h3>&ltfigure&gt: The "Figure" element</h3>
        <p>
            A figure element is used to house self-contained content, or content that is usually related to the rest of 
            the document but can be viewed independently. Consider images, code snipets, diagrams and other such items, 
            all should be viewable independently of the surrounding context. A figure has the optional <a>&ltfigcaption&gt</a> which
            is meant to contain a brief description summerizing the contents of the figure.

            <h3>&ltdiv&gt: The "Div" element</h3>
            <p>
                A div is the most generic sectioning element available. It is meant to be used when no other semantic elments are applicable,
                and is typically used to facilitate styling for its content.

            <h3>&ltheader&gt: The "Header" element</h3>
            <p>
                The header element is used to represent introductory content and like the &ltfooter&gt element, 
                it can be used multiple times in a docmument if appropriate. It will usually contain items such as a title,
                navigation links, a search form, or anything relevant for leading into the follow up content.

        </main>">
            <h3>&ltmain&gt: The "Main" element</h3>
            <p>
                The main element is used to encase the focus of  a document or the most important content. This does not neccisarily mean that the main
                element will sturcturally be at the center of a document, it simply means that it's content is the dominant content.
                A main element is supposed to be unique to a document which means it should avoid using content that is repeated across any others.
