        <section id="intro" class="subject">As you might have read from the introduction HTML is an element driven language
            and while this gives us a number of elements we can chose from to work with, where we place them how we organize them 
            is realy important both for porper semantics and for referencing when looking for the items in a javascript file. Hence Sectioning
            tags or tags that are specifically made to make the separation of portions with some more generic than others. With some of the more specifically
            named ones usually reserved for commonly designated portions such as header, footer, or aside. In this area we will be going over some of these tags.

        <address>">
            <h3>&ltaddress&gt: The "Address" element</h3>
            <p>
               The &ltaddress&gt elment is used for indicating that the content contained within is some sort of contact information.
               The contact information provided can be actuall addresses email or otherwise, phone numbers, social media handles, and so on.
               This elment can be included multiple times in a document if appropriate. Take for example an online magazine with more than one 
               article in a page each with different authors, you could include and address element for each of the articles as needed. 
               The text included within the elment will be italicized by default.

            <h3>&ltarticle&gt: The "Article" element</h3>
            <p>
                The &ltarticle&gt elemet is used for sections that are meant to be resused in other works or can be used independently from the rest of the document.
                Consider items such as seperate articles in a magazine, an individual post, or some interactive widget such as the one used in this site. 
                It has no special renduring and can be styled by name in CSS.

            The &ltaside&gt element is used for sections of a document that are in someway related to the main portion, 
            but can be seperated for a better flow of content. Consider tips, notes, sidebars and other such examples. Slightly different
            from an <a href="#article">article</a> element in that it is typically ment to remain connected to the main content. 
            The element provides no special renduring but can by styled by name using CSS.
